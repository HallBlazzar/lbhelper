Setup And Installation
======================

To build a Debian image with ``lbhelper``, you need:

1. A system with runnable live build binary. In general, if you run with Debian based Linux distribution,
   you can install it via ::

     sudo apt install live-build

   For non-Debian based system, the `live build official documents <https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/html/live-manual/installation.en.html>`__ might help.
